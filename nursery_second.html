	</p>	

	<p>
	 <div class="content-block">
	<div class="content-block-inner">
			The Woodbury Jewish Center Vivien Grossman Early Childhood Education Program focuses on the physical, social, emotional, spiritual, and cognitive needs of each individual child in a warm, creative, engaging, and loving Jewish environment.  It is our intent that the relationships, experiences, and memories of each child and their family be lasting ones that help pave the way for a happy and successful childhood and establish the foundation for a positive Jewish identity.  We believe that play is the work of children and it our goal to partner with each family and provide an environment where each individual child can thrive, grow, and feel good about themselves.  It is this partnership and solid relationship building that fosters an excitement for lifelong learning.

		<div class="content-block">
		<div class="content-block-inner">
			
			Our child centered, play-based curriculum provides an exciting and developmentally appropriate environment that fosters learning through engaging and meaningful experiences and establishes a solid foundation for continuous growth, positive self-image, and Jewish learning.  Activities include:  art expression, music, literacy and writing readiness, math activities, science exploration, language development, movement, cooking, dramatic play, block building and manipulatives, gardening and nature, multiple sensory experiences, and Judaism.</p>
			<p>
			Daily activities include a balance of quiet and active play and a balance of large and small muscle activities.  There are options for both small and large group activities, and a balance of both child and teacher initiated activities. Weather permitting, children participate in daily outdoor play in our playground and outdoor learning environment. In inclement weather, children participate in indoor play in our well-equipped gym. </p>
			<p>
			Each week children participate in music class and visits from our rabbi and cantor.  Special programs are also presented during the year to enhance the children’s experiences.</p>
