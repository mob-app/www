		At Woodbury Jewish Center, we seek to provide our students with the 
		highest level of knowledge, strong skills for participation in our religion, a positive feeling about synagogue involvement and an 
		extremely close identification with the State of Israel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our school integrates experiential learning with traditional classroom 
		instruction to provide an atmosphere in which learning is fun through 
		participation and interesting activities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Preparation for Bar/Bat Mitzvah begins in the Alef year, which is the 
		3rd Grade. We provide intensive instruction for learning the Hebrew 
		language, as well as instruction for Hebrew conversation and prayer. Our cantors provide tefillah instruction to our students on an ongoing 
		basis, which is the preparation for Bar/Bat Mitzvah.
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		We observe Jewish holidays through many different programs and 
		activities, i.e. crafting Havdalah candles, making a menorah and 
		preparing a Shofar from a ram's horn.
	</p>
	<p>
		We encourage students to give to charities of their choosing through 
		tzedakah donations. We also provide trips to entertain at assisted 
		living residences and other sites of Jewish interest. Prior to Bar/Bat 
		Mitzvah, each student prepares a Mitzvah Project.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our school's philosophy stresses positive reinforcement through awards assemblies, special trips and student teaching. Many of our students 
		continue their Jewish education after Bar/Bat Mitzvah in our Hebrew High
		School.
