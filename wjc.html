		In 1989, the Woodbury Jewish Center began as an idea in the hearts and minds of a small group of dedicated families. Since that time, I have had the pleasure of watching our congregation and synagogue grow into a wonderful center of Jewish life.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, we have over 400 member families, with room for significantly more. Our mission is to be both a beacon and a mooring for families interested in traditional Judaic values.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Our activities are broad in scope and include spiritual, social, and educational opportunities for each and every one of us:</li>
		<li>Our nursery school introduces Jewish holidays, customs and traditions to over 200 delightful pre-kindergardeners</li>
		<li>Our religious school educates over 300 children in Hebrew history, thought, values and language</li>
		<li>Our Youth Group for pre-Bar/Bat Mitzvahs and USY Group for teens each offers a full calendar of secular and religious events</li>
		<li>Our Men's Club and Sisterhood hold monthly meetings and sponsor a wide range of social gatherings and community services</li>
		<li>Our adult education curriculum covers a rich course of studies into our common heritage and includes an adult bar/bat mitzvah program</li>
		<li>Our seniors group is now established and active; and</li>
		<li>Our schedule of worship extends from weekday minyans, to weekly Shabbat services, to the High Holidays.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For so many of us, the Woodbury Jewish Center has become an extended family with whom simchas are joyously celebrated and times of sorrow and need are supportively shared.
	</p>
	<p>
		We would be delighted to have you join our family. Each member of the Board of Trustees and I would be pleased to help you learn more about our congregation. We can be reached through the synagogue office at 516-496-9100. We look forward to hearing from you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Shalom,<br>

		President, Woodbury Jewish Center
